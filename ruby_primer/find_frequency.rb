Find the frequency of a string in a sentence

Problem Statement
Given a sentence containing multiple words, find the frequency of a given word in that sentence.

Construct a method named 'find_frequency' which accepts two arguments 'sentence' and 'word',
both of which are String objects.

Example: The method, given 'Ruby is The best language in the World' and 'the', should return 2
(comparison should be case-insensitive).

Hint: You can use the method Array#count to count the frequency of any element in the given array. eg:

[9,3,4,9,5].count(9)
Will return the value 2

def find_frequency(sentence, word)
  sentence.downcase.split(' ').count(word.downcase)
end
